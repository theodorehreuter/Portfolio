# Portfolio
This is the github portfolio of Theodore Reuter, and seeks to represent my technical GIS abilities in a range of areas, from spatial analysis and spatial statistics (poster/slides in powerpoint format for class), python scripts, and website samples, Esri storymaps, and other various pieces of GIS work.

As a note, some scripts were written with python 2.7.  I have migrated and now write all my scripts in python 3.

My favorite script to date is atri_core.py, written for the USDOT, where the script successfully ingests millions of gps points and produces a table summarizing truck trips through polygons of interest.
