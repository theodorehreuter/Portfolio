# Portfolio
This is my github portfolio to demonstrate scripts and code I've written, during grad school and for work.

As a note, some scripts were written with python 2.7.  I have migrated and now write all my scripts in python 3.

As of 9/12/2019, there are scripts yet to be added to this repository, including a script using numpy, pandas, geospandas, shapely. It is in the process of being approved for export from a secured server used at work.
