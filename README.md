# Portfolio
This is my github portfolio to demonstrate scripts and code I've written, during grad school and for work.

As a note, most of the python scripts were written in python 2.7 because that is what was taught in class so python 2 syntax is present in a number of these scripts.  I have converted and now write all my scripts in python 3.

As of 8/2/2019, there are multiple scripts yet to be added to this repository it is a work in progress.  If you would like to see more scripts please do not hesitate to reach out to me.
