# Portfolio
This is my github portfolio to to demonstrate a variety of projects and scripts and code I've written, during grad school and for work, to illustrate my GIS capabilities and work.

As a note, some scripts were written with python 2.7.  I have migrated and now write all my scripts in python 3.
