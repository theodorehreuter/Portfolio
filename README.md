# Portfolio
Portfolio to demonstrate scripts and code I've written 

The various scripts and webpages here represent various pieces of coding I wrote during grad school and various jobs.

As a note, most of the python scripts were written in python 2.7 because that is what was taught in class.  I have convertedto python 3 and which is what all my python scripts are now written in.

As of 8/2/2019, there are many scripts yet to be added to this repository it is a work in progress.  If you would like to see more scripts please do not hesitate to reach out to me.
