# Portfolio
This is my github portfolio to demonstrate scripts and code I've written, during grad school and for work.

As a note, some scripts were written with python 2.7.  I have migrated and now write all my scripts in python 3.

As of 9/3/2019, there are scripts yet to be added to this repository, it is a work in progress.  If you would like to see more scripts please do not hesitate to reach out to me.
