            <p class="lead">Near misses are encounters cyclists have on the road that represented a severe risk of boildy harm.
                This can be cars pulling out in front of you, a car passing on the left and making a sharp right turn in front you,
                a car blowing past you at high speed and passing very closely, a person opening a car door into a bike lane, 
                a cars driving extremely close behind you, and similar events.  In such events, if things were slightly different, 
                could have resulted in serious injury or death for a cyclist.

            <p class="lead">There are few if any tools for collecting data on near misses.  There is <a href="https://www.bikelaneuprising.com/washington-dc"> Bike Lane Uprising </a>
            which currently allows users to submit a record and photo of an obstructino in a bike lane, a persistant problem.  There is 
            <a href="https://twitter.com/howsmydrivingdc?lang=en">How's My Driving Twitter Bot</a> which users can use to find if a driver in the DMV has any citations or unpaid tickets. Hopefully
            this will motivate DC Police to crack down on habitually unsafe drivers, the ones at a might higher risk of causing an accident. DC Police track accidents involving bicyclists 
            <a href="http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/crashes-in-dc">here</a>.   This data can also be found on my maps page <a href="maps.html">here.</a>
            Near misses occur on a daily basis to cyclists all over DC.  I personally lost count years ago of my close calls I have had biking in DC.
            Information on the daily state of living as a cyclist in DC will hopefully motivate politicans and law enforcement to take stronger action to protect 
            cyclists while advocates can add another tool to their arguments in the public sphere.</p>

                a year ago, anywhere in the area.  Your data point will be automatically added to the maps on this website - reload the page and you should see your 
                near miss added to the map.  You can also find some links to ArcGIS Online, where these feature classes are stored and updated.  Any data collected
